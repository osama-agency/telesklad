## Installation

1. Download/fork/clone the repo. Once you're in the correct directory, it's time to install all the necessary dependencies. You can do this by typing the following command:

```
npm install
```
> Some packages *may* cause peer-dependency issue with React 19. So if you face any issues while installing, use the optional `--legacy-peer-deps` command.


1. Okay, you're almost there. Now all you need to do is start the development server. If you're using **npm**, the command is:

```
npm run dev
```
And if you're using **Yarn**, it's:

```
yarn dev
```

And voila! You're now ready to start developing. **Happy coding**!
